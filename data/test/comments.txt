wait kyle oquinn is a black dude 
Its OK Well keep him Why complain when you have Tony Parker
Lets try to keep bazemores passing to a minimum
True but how would a new fan know that this has been posted before Cant blame him for wanting to expand his nba knowledge 
That 2009 draft netted like 7 starting PGs that are still in the league today on top of another 5 backup PGs good ones Rubio Curry Jennings Tyreke Evans who played like a PGhybrid guard his rookie year Holiday Lawson Teague Patrick Beverley Then you have Toney Douglas the backup PG for the Warriors Nick Calathes and Patty Mills Tony Parkers backup And James Harden whos like a hybrid 12 with the amount he takes the ball up and handles the ball To have THAT many PGs from one draft still starting and playing in this league 4 years later is fucking impressive
By 7
LaMarcus or Serge Ibaka woulda looked realllllly nice though Maybe we make the Thunder the strongest team ever but Pau Kobe Serge could definitely hold out And if we moved Pau for nothing but a pick and signed Carmello Wed be really really awesome and fun to watch So much midrange  
Dont make Magic fans cry Ognjen
The same shots that were falling a minute ago arent anymore and our bench looks like shit again
Is his name Onion
Yes but thats why I cant convince some of my friends to watch basketball The last two minutes take an hour And theyre right 
In 1984 16 of 23 teams made the Playoffs
Hes playing in the Euroleague this season but the Bulls are expecting him to come over after this season Hes easily the best international player in the world at the moment and is dominating over there I know its not a definite hell get the same results in the NBA but either way he spaces the floor has tons of potential and would be a top 3 pick if he were in this years draft No way would the Bulls give him up and 2 as of now first round draft picks for this years draft for an expiring contract even if it is Melo and JR Smith
pronounced almost exactly like that
Kuzmic is officially back
Lens 71 260 and only 20 years old  Lots of room to grow That bench is going to be something like Gerald Green two Morris twins Len and a bunch of studs from this 2014 draft with capspace to pickup a premier max free agent to start at the 3 or 4 alongside Plumlee and DragicBledsoe  Thats dirty
Lets see some defense Kings
Honest question does Fisher get his number up there If Fisher goes up Pau goes up 
lt3
Phonetically yes  Ownyen Spelled Ogjnen or something like that 
Heh some kids chanting Lets go Warriors
HAPPY NEW YEAR FROM BAHRAIN 
Backcourt  guards My top 3 backcourts this season CurryThompson DragicBledsoe WallBeal 
I think its more like Ohgnion
Basically They cant turn the ball over like this vs Miami thats for sure
I wouldnt say shit considering they are playing defense well and the offense actually built the lead up this quarter
Got to be Lowry and Ross
You cream puffs ready for an ass whoopin Just kidding heres to a GG Brooklyn bros Happy New Years everyone heres to another year of drunken postgame rambling with you all
Pronounced onyen
Big Dick Dray sits and it looks a little more sloppy out there
gthes been huge Ya got that right There is a reason his nickname is Land Walrus 
Im starting to feel bad for Barnes Hes been in a slump for such a long time
No injuries pls
Barnes is really struggling
He has about 75 friends and family there Speights trying to show out 
OverUnder Durant with 40 Pts
I feel like itd be a huge time commitment for guys who are on the road so much  Ive seen a couple players tweet about their fantasy fb teams but never fantasy bball
Gonna be a great game Would love to see Durant guard LMA late in the game if its close He got the length
Thanks man Been using your streams religiously and love them I was wondering if there is a way to full screen it on a laptop browser firefox that I am just not seeing or not 
but theres no picture of YFW 
No breaks just tears The shooting guards are getting the breaks this year
Yeah but the technology nowadays is way better than before and should be taken advantage of to call it as accurately as possible
Looking forward to this game  aww yeahh
Woo go Raptors somebody hit us up with a stream pls lt3
Ive been on a roadtrip for the past 2 weeks I havent kept up with any basketball What happened with Asik How have the Rockets been
He is a good 3pt shooter and will only continue to get better but your reasoning is based purely on stats Lebron has been taking probably the best shots you can in a game and this has led to his phenomenal percentages He shoots mainly wide open 3 point shots and if he is contested defenders usually give him a lot of space because hes so good at getting to the rim So hes a good 3pt shooter for sure but you cant just say hes better than Kobe at 3pt shooting because of his percentages Kobe has a tendency to take illadvised shots and that lowers his percentages But he is a really good 3pt shooter still Lebrons jumpshot has gotten much better over the years but I think the increase in efficiency is because he takes the best possible shots he can His jumpshot is still not as reliable as Kobes
Click on the video and it should go Full Screen 
Go Marlins
                      Upvote this if                    you are a beautiful strong Knicks fan                  who dont need no draft picks             
I havent watched NBA just watched some basket in the olympics is James Harden still good
Even without flair what he said is still accurate
Guess thats why he just tried for 3
Sure can Its always good to hear from your perspective sometimes and can be productive to include coaches as well
Small forward isnt part of a backcourt
There are dozens of us DOZENS
We need to force feed Kuzmic the ball in the post This is not the way to win basketball games the way were playing right now omitting Kuzmic from the offense
When Speights goes for the 3 you know our team has collectively stopped giving a shit
Whut
That is a false comparison though You cannot say had they not got those points they definitely wouldnt have made it up elsewhere Psychology plays a role in the flow of a basketball game  You can without a doubt make the argument that this call directly changed the outcome of the game 
guys looking to get their shots up
Barnes has been struggling ever since Iguodala came back
See Just give Kuzmic the ball and we win
Wilt Kuzmic with bucket 
Wow didnt realize that OKC has had the third longest HC  
What if they are the same size
He sort of is in one already Hell always be good enough to have offenses designed around him hell just post up more often Id imagine
Nets fans know 
Saying that it was a foul is just politics placating the noisy folks by doing something while not actually doing anything or angering the other sides noisy folks I doubt they even looked at the replay
Gonna be all kinds of Gay in Houston tonight 
Loving the Pacific at the moment Its anyones game between the Clips Suns and Dubs
In Toronto we have the sprite zone where its at the very farthest point in the upper level Its where the true fans go 
Kyrie Irving had his L knee Xrayed but still returned to the game He plans to have an MRI Wed Said he felt a pop it didnt feel right From one of the Pacers beat guys on twitter
Depending on what state you live in you should just reach out to the organization running your area Probably 50 of the states are run by IAABO but a google search of your town should prove helpful I would assume its already too late for this year but wouldnt hurt to try
EVERY TEAM THAT BEAT THE BLAZERS DESERVE NOTHING  THE BLAZERS ONLY BEAT THEMSELVES AND YOUR TEAM SUCKS
Wilt Kuzmic with the massive bucket to put the game away with 20 seconds to go
6 games in a row Going for 7  Miami
Derrick Rose cant shoot from his suit jacket
GG
Happy New Years Eve fellas
Just click on the video duuuuud Oh someone was so much faster 
Jeez now you have me feeling for a Bulls rival  
Yeah but I mean just focus on rebounding and put on some Karl Malone weight As much as possible hell slow down eventually 
 Pelicans allow 5 points per 100 possessions fewer with AD on the floor  Hes leading the league in blocks with 15 steals  Pelicans defensive rebounding is 5 better with AD on the floor  Pelicans block more than twice as many shots with AD on the floor Its hard for me to say how much of that is due to lack of competent backupssquads because Im not personally very familiar with the NOP bench but those sound like DPOY candidate stats although no probably not a favorite Especially if he plays better after the allstar break which I wouldnt be surprised by at all
Sneakily athletic and a real gym rat
Highlight reel for sure
Yes they should I have no idea why we cut him
I didnt realize he was beasting DLeague We should have tried playing him more
Haha Brrr
Flip Murray You were a beast when Ray Allen missed the first two weeks of the 2003 season
Which is odd as Klay Andre and DLee have broken out of their slumps 
Any streams that work on mobile Specifically iPhone
What a great vid thanks for posting I often think of things from the players side since that always intrigues me but this insight was something Ive never seen and this video just sucked me in  I moved around a lot when I was a kid and the first time I moved it was a huge deal after the 2nd time I acted like AG and just kind of had the been there done that vibe Its weird to relate to professionals you often view in a robotic view I realize theyre people but their feelings never register while watching the games 
WOOF 
gt You cream puffs ready for an ass whoopin Yes yes we are
Diggin the throwbacks 
His care for an inanimate object is commendable
I guess Iguodala is the glue guy 6 in a row
I have a horrible feeling that this game is only going to contribute to my general pessimism towards 2014
damn bmac
Maybe Iguodala does actually make the other players better since he plays with the starters Mark should play Iguodala and Barnes at the same time more I liked it when they were in at the same time vs the Clippers
boogie should not dribble the ball up
That Xavier Henry dunk though
Good point I agree that LeBron definitely takes 3s more judiciously However Kobes 3pt shooting has been pretty dismal for the past couple years and not all of that is due to his illadvised shots  Kobe from 3 335 for his career and below that average for his past 4 seasons   Kobe also never showed any type of development in his longrange shooting He has been consistently mediocre from 3 for his career and has taken the same illadvised shots for his career 
Pau could have easily taken either one of those Finals MVP trophies if everyone wasnt so partial to Kobe And btw remember January of 2008 when Bynum went down with an injury which then prompted the Lakers to go after Pau Yeah he was with the Lakers for like half the season and managed to go 225 with him in the lineup I think the Lakers went to Game 7 vs the Celtics that year and lost  Frankly the Lakers would have never made it the Finals wo Pau Sure the same could easily said in relation to Kobe being there but each time a big man had be brought in order to put them over the edge remember Shaq and mediocrity that followed the Lakers once he left No one wins a title alone Not Kobe not Jordan and certainly not Dirk who had HOFer Jason Kidd former 6th Man of the Year Jason Terry Tyson Chandler who won the DPOY award just a year later and of course Shawn Marion who shut down LeBron and just dropped 32 6 and 3 just last night 
Jnzi is always here for us
Well the 8th seed knicks made it to finals so theres that
Lets see what happens when LeBron loses a step and defenders no longer have to sag off to defend him from the three point line You think hell still be shooting 40 from 3 
The Charlotte front office is going to ruin those dope new logos with shitty uniform design
Career night for McLemore I HOPE SO
2 quick fouls for Joe Johnson is not good 
6 in a row Lets see the Heat get through the Dubs with this momentum
jesus christ mclemore
If Tiggalo Spliggalo makes you look flatfooted as a defender you really really stink
Yeah its those 3 for me as well Strictly on a skill basis I think you have to consider LinHarden although it works much better on paper than it does in practice  Then you have the second tier which in my opinion consists of HolidayGordon CalderonEllis CP3Crawford
Anyone know why keep playing the Nets on the 31st of December
where is beverly Ive been out of town for 2 weeks and havent kept up with the rockets
Pretty unusual for him too Hes usually decent at contesting without fouling
Hopefully once Andre and his hammy are completely healthy Barnes for Bogut will be the first sub  Right now I wouldnt mind seeing Barnes and Green come in for Iguodala and LeeBogut depending on matchups 
Really proud of the way the bench played Having all the starters rest for the entire 4th q is pretty big 
I wouldnt build my franchise around either I assume you didnt mean to word it that way  As far as who Id rather have during the draft I was higher on McLemore but it looks like Hardaways game has transferred to better to the NBA McLemore is too passive for my liking Unless he changes his mentality he probably wont be a star
More likely Aron Baynes Jeff Errors isnt that young played for Blazers and Pacers previously Baynes is fairly new
I predict that the Miami Heat and Indiana Pacers will make the playoffs
Bazemore balls David lee pumpfakes blocks shots and hit a jumper Bogut made some post moves Is this real life
checkered 
I guess we sometimes forget theyre actual people when all we see is them on the court and in box scores
Oo  theyre talking trash about the nocall at the end of DalMin haha
gt On September 23 2013 he signed with the Golden State Warriors However he was later waived by the Warriors on October 25 On November 1 2013 he was acquired by the Santa Cruz Warriors the DLeague affiliate of Golden State On November 18 2013 he resigned with the Golden State Warriors The next day he was assigned back down to Santa Cruz On November 20 he was recalled On November 24 he was reassigned On November 25 he was recalled On December 5 2013 he was waived by Golden State On December 10 he was reacquired by Santa Cruz Poor guy deserves to be anywhere besides Golden State at this point
man shots fired at ed malloy
Go black and white team
Kuzmic pulling some hakeem moves at the end of the game
Probably something to do with the fact that we both have lengthy road trips the rodeo for you and the circus for us that would make arrangements difficult later in the season Its also a pretty quiet lowinterest game and I imagine they like to schedule those on evenings when the viewing figures will be low anyhow
Bazemore coming of the bench with double digits is awesome
Can someone explain why the Knicks got rid of Donnie Walsh
Shit now that is BOLD
Dont worry man  I still preciate you
Bevs injured
Im squinting so that I can pretend that this is going to be a home win rather than a road loss
Fractured hand
DJ Augustin explodes this game called it
Tits What happened
and then the flattest jumper Ive ever seen lol
THUNDER UP
I also predict that Pop will keep his job at the end of the year
But when our fans go home they arent embarrassed to have spent money to watch a team with no future
way to keep your head in the game JT
Reddit sidebar schedule is wrong  This game is at 800 EST not 700  I was freaking out about the lack of streams
yes
What do you know Play him at SG instead of PG and suddenly he looks like a serviceable player
Hes probably seeing fewer doubles on the block
God damn Dwight
Its more fun  I wish football did it  And not just because I am a Raider fan  Wed miss anyways 
this is gonna be bad
You mean the same year your team had their best season ever and lost in the first round too
Is it me or has Clyde been nicer to jlin recently Maybe hes been reading our comments lol
and fanbase how the hell can you make a statement like that I come from an incredibly white area that loves the Lakers so why dont the Lakers have the whitest fanbase too
Totally agree Amazing man Loved watching him for 4 years at Baylor
Dang  Dwight FTs 04 already
First you came off as a dick then tried to back pedal a tad to seem nicer before finally going for the jugular I like that 
I just listened to that radio broadcast by the Timberwolves where he just yells Ahhh  ED MALLOY with a WTF you piece of shit type of shrill
Hell still be 68 270ish pounds a matchup nightmare for anyone even with diminished physical capabilities Hell gradually lose speedquickness but his size will remain exceptional Kobe is a couple inches shorter and 50lbs lighter Its a testament to Kobes absurd midrange game and phenomenal postgame that he played as well as he did last year considering his age and his relatively poor 3pt shooting 
I tuned in to the game with the mind set of lets see how bad this Nets team really is and how its possible I tuned in from 8 mins left in the 1st the sequence of events was DWill airball Timmy D made shot J Terry Turnover with a carry Nets 3 in the key Bellinelli layup YUP thats enough for me They are just as bad as they say
i have no attachment to any of these players anymore ship everyone out
Did tjones shave another candy cane into his head or is that his hair growing back weird
He can barely keep his head in his headband
FUCK ED MALLOY
As an Australian foreigner that Nets color guy has a really thick NY accent which I always associate with George Costanza
To be fair hes still shooting 44 same as last year and improved from 35 to 40 from 3 point range Hes young hes obviously not played his best so to say hell improve by seasons end isnt a stretch
Weve really looked like an averagemiddling playoff team this past month
yeah you pushed it
Irving on knee I thought the worst had happenedI was praying to God when I came in here everything was going to be OK
That stare that Belinelli gave JT 
Very good point although I would advise teams to start doubling him 
i liked playing him next to Steph and Douglas
Yeah first time I heard his voice and damn he sounds look like a damn good coach haha
I really like the Rockets announcers
Fratello Hes from Jersey
Seriously Theyre pretty bad
Not many share that sentiment I like them fine
What theyre supposed to do is punish referees for screwing up instead of setting up a system that is surprisingly similar to tenured professors at a shitty university 
Sounds similar to me
ITS OKAY HES NEVER BEEN TO MIAMI
Hes quickly becoming my favorite player Also his name is Boris Bobo Babacar Diaw The best
I figure it as this frontcourt are taking up the paint area SF is often on the wing and making assists such as the Guards In the All Star voting there is two players on the frontcourt option 
Thats probably the first time Ive ever seen another teams fan say that on here
AS BARGNANI WOULD SAY SAUCE
this game is demoralizing to watch
Looking good Spurs lets keep it up  
This Popovich guy looks promising
I suppose they are Im English but Ive lived here long enough to pick up a difference There are even slight variations in the accent from borough to borough and between NYC proper and the NJLI suburbs
ugh do they have to show those pacers highlights every single time 
I love the brand new Suns team
WCF preview Should be a great game
Jason Terry is Shaqtin a fool and the Nets are down 10 by the first commercial break The Bball Gods hate NY
KEEP IT ROUGHLY 500 LIKE THE ROMANS
And if you dont like that then you dont like KingRockeumNBA basketball
a ton of assumptions in your post IF Lebrons athleticism declines is he more likely to still finish in the paint or get assists Im not sure its finish in the paint And Lebron doesnt need to be in the post to facilitate Hes actually just started doing that In Cleveland he rarely posted and got all his assists on the perimeter and through p nd r
Big Dick Draby 
DWill to the rockets trade sounds so good right now 
KG sucks and its painful to watch Terry makes stupid mistakes DWill cant make his shots
source
WHAT DOES THAT EVEN MEAN
Yeah We need more videos like this
Dont hashtag here son
Ben playin some great D
The Spurs have the Baseline Bums They have been around since the ABA days
115 in December even with all those injuries gotta love that
This game looks like a SAS intrasquad scrimmage with the starters going against the third string
Ya between this show Open Court and the game recaps with 3D and Barry that channel is my go to place outside of primetime
Maybe Im just really hungry but every time I see TJones hair I want to go to McDonalds and order a McFlurry
Great hustle by Lin and T Jones
LEAGUE AVERAGE BITCHES 
ISAIAH THOMAS STILL HAS A HIGHER PER THAN KYRIE MUFUCKAS
Perkins up
gtBut I feel like assists for a guy who doesnt play the point depend a little more on the system and your teammates than how gifted an athlete you are  thats an irrelevant generalization Lebron has had full point guard abilities throughout his entire career its not a product of the system that generalization might be true for some players but its just a bad one because each case is different
Thats also a risky move since hes such a capable and creative passer Old Boris really is a useful player
OGAWD IF DWIGHT GOT THAT
20131230 Wtf day did this happen I cant understand these numbers Is it some sort of code
Illuminati 
Very true  He also locked up Lebron in game 5 of the finals NEVER FORGET
Do not want
In 2014 the Knicks will make me cry 
Yup Parsons was the only player to last from the end of two years ago to the end of last year Greg Smith was on the Dleague every single other player on the roster two years ago was gone by the end of last year 
GO TORONTO ARGONAUTS
right I thought anyone supporting that was fucking high finally taking my homer glasses off
What The Spurs and Heat werent in the finals The finals never even happened Everyone just went home after the conference finals last year and all was right in the world of basketball
It doesnt help that their jerseys are red and yellow
Thats a lot to give up for Melo and fucking JR Smith
secretly dougs dad
not gonna lie i didnt realize that was novak i thought he was some team assistant guy
Why didnt he feed to JT 
Fuck that guy Ive been rooting for melo for so long How the fuck is he the disappointment  Does he even watch basketball  I STILL LOVE YOU MELO PAY NO ATTENTION TO THE HATERS 
Open gym is a great show I just wish more teams did it 
Does anybody know how to invert the colours on their TV screen Ive just found a way for us to win this game
Im home from college and nobody I know from high school is home so Im celebrating New Years with a nice beer and this match up Very excited for the gamethe Thunders newfound postWestbrook edge will be great to watch  Happy new year rNBA Its been a pleasure watching with you all 
Favorite moment NBA Finals games 6 and 7 I will never forget my reactions and the moment Ray hit that 3 in game 6 in particular Prediction Lebron stays in Miami
Rockets with some active hands They need to pick up the intensity though
Anderson is making it personal
Woman Canadians though theyre evil
Youre a tough man if they havent yet
too bad they have a shit owner one that puts saving pennies ahead of winning a title since mike left 
Dream Jiggle  
I dont think he gives a shit about that really
Did both teams start celebrating New Years early Such slop
While its technically hand on hand contact Marions blocking the ball through the top of Loves hand Since when was that considered hand is part of the ball Ive seen people get called for fouls when the defender just touches the players hand on the followthrough and that affects the shooter a lot less than completely altering their attempt to release their shot 
Im from the future its 2014 here Thunder wins 10795 
Great its fun to watch
10
I can see a team like the Kings being willing to trade their pick if its topten for three of the Suns picks in the draft They can def use one of those picks in a trade for an established player and then pick up two fucking solid role players to shore up their bench either from the draft or use those picks to trade for one as well 
Rudy Tre
So about 200 people is considered half of an NBA arena now Damn ticket sales have plummeted
I always liked Flip Murray  Im cheering for Ricky Davis to get picked up though
I was pulling for Jarvis Varnado to make a splash in the NBA I loved watching him in college Looks like his window may be closing fast 
HOW DARE YOU TRY AND BREAK UP THE MORRIS TWINS HAVE YOU NO SOUL
I hope the game is still great even with Russ out  I was surprised at the win over the Rockets so maybe they can pull something crazy out here too Thunder Up 
Owners cant play for their own team 
Dont they have a backup ref sitting in the refs locker room So it isnt that far out of there for them to do this
Kirilenko just watched Ayres get the offensive board
I dunno you should be able to answer that question better considering you just described a guy on your roster
fucken clyde manrudy gay has been on a bunch of bad teamstorontomemphis well he had a good run with memphis 
What was that A rugby scrum
I think Mr Cooper from Hangin with Mr cooper is available  He had an awesome ten day stint with the Warriors back in the day  You would probably get Holly RobinsonPeete at the games also
YOU WOULD
THE FUCK IS THIS SPURS FANS ARE COWBOYS FANS
NBA got to call up Boris to participate in the skills challenge man
Thats actually what they want to do a while back they made the offer for one or two of their picks for a star player but no one bit Personally I think the knicks should try and get them for Melo since this season is effectively over and hes gonna walk for nothing next year Maybe we can convince the nuggets to give us their pick if we do it since wed effectively be tanking and thus increasing the value of their trade
This entire team is a shaqtin highlight reel
Welcome to 2014
163 when all 5 starters are available 
KINGS have so many guys that can create their own shots
It feels so nice 
Youve never played rugby have you
I find it funny that a couple of TWolves fans said similar statements throughout the thread but you are the one with downvotes
In fairness most of Memphis post season success came without Rudy shit I think they never actually won an actual series where Rudy played
I switched from the HD stream to a low quality stream just because I could not stand him He said all of the annoying cliches and added nothing of value to the broadcast Very annoying
I dont know if you meant literal wolverine shit but Im definitely construing it that way
Man ever since that San Antonio games things have been trending down Hopefully with the new year well get a new effort
Theyre going a bit far the other way and nocalling Harden now 
The Nets are doing the impossible making Jeff Ayres look good
Hed back his way down the entire court and every shot would be a hook
holy shit
Maybe but because there is a rookie scale so the impact of not getting to your second contract a year earlier could be worse than staying an extra year in college Also If you get bumped 5 spots up there is also a chance you go to a rebuilding team rather than a contender I mean 5 picks could be the difference between the Hawks A playoff team with some pieces and the Wolves who will probably give away love and be in rebuilding mode  
Obligatory would smash comment for the Bay Ridge Honda girl
no
Yes and Mchale responds by subbing Lin out 
Favourite moment Danny Green and Gary Neal raining threes on the Heat in Game 3 of the finals  Bold Prediction Coach Nick will join Grantland
YEA WHY NOT
I will never forget the day Aaron Brooks gave up a tooth to save possession for the Kings only to have them turn the ball over on the next play
Didnt watch the game Why did Vucevic play so little Dont tell me he got hurt
They just said James Harden rarely complains about not getting foul calls Ive seen him complain a lot
We traded for Kobe Bryant  oh wait its you bastards that have knee problems now My bad 
I have three scars on my head one on each arm and five across my legs from various rugby scrums Shit gets rowdy in there
Toronto wins 10298
Damn my master plan has failed
Is there anyone else aside from the Kings Big Three Boogie Gay IT
I like everything except the Bulls trade No way the Bulls give up so much for half a season of Melo when Rose is most likely not coming back I could see it happening if they kept the picks and we kept JR though No way they give up any pick in next years draft and an unprotected pick from a perennially terrible team 
Not sure how they missed that call Maybe they need permanent refs on the baseline as someone suggested in another thread
Hopefully hes okay Dudes a baller 
Oh
Thunder make the finals against the Pacers and win 42
Isnt that like below the poverty line in the US
 Holy shit this Pizza Guy commercial being aired twice every commercial break is absolutely killing me
Mike For my New Years resolution Im trying to get down to five percent body fat Ian Where are you now Mike I got a ways to go
OUR ARENA IS IN OAKLAND BUT WERE SUPPOSED TO REPRESENT BOTH OAKLAND AND SF HENCE WHY OUR LOGO IS THE BAY BRIDGE WHICH CONNECTS THE TWO CITIES EDIT FUCK THE CLIPPERS
Haha just saw Anchorman 2 yesterday Good movie
When Marcus Thornton is on he does a pretty good job of it McLemore has some moments where he can do this  THats about it 
Favorite moment kicking the trailblazers ASS Bold prediction bye kevin 
THATI could see
But making pizza is just like being a PG man
Jimmer scored  Drink now
I think he partially tore something
Not really an arena thing but two things former Celtics used to do Ricky Davis used to buy tickets for kids every game and they were called the Get Buckets Brigade and Scalabrines fans were affectionately referred to as Scals Pals  Both still make me laugh
Yeah so MIN had the right ideabut blew it by drafting and keeping Flynn instead trading Ty 
Ankle in the first quarter 
i honestly love you
We really need to get out of this shooting slump These past few games have been painful to watch
Gonna go with the UNDER on this one  Not because he cant do it but because the game is going to be over in the third and Durant is going to sit the entire fourth   I can dream
Obviously youre not a pizza guy
I dont think the call is a literal delay of game The rule is in place to encourage quick inbounding when the team with possession decides to do so In other words its meant to discourage players from grabbing the ball and meandering so their defense can get set 
Lol Acy guarding Dwight 
More entertainment for fans so Im not complaining
IT only seems like alot because these East first round series are gonna be terrible
Favorite moment for me Paul Georges dunk on Birdman  Prediction Warriors or Rockets will be on the finals
McLemore is more of a catch and shoot off screens type of guy though right  Although if he can take folks off the dribble soon you might end up with Ray Allen type of player  Heres hoping too  I have high hopes
Hahaha I just watched the game and didnt catch this
Are post entries that hard
To be fair I highly doubt the DLeague is even in the black much less a major moneymaker for the league
Comment above our conversation
did you know that the blazers held the top spot in the west for a few weeks and nobody gave a fuck anyway
Hes a Heat fan It means He really liked the Bulls in the  nineties  Hes a Yankees fan  Big fan of the 90s Cowboys  Oh just like Lebron I was born in Ohio but coincidentally rooted for all the winning franchises when I was growing up James 
03 lol
OKC is going to win tonight to end the calender year on a high note and OU is going to win on Thursday to begin the calender year on a high note   And together they shall usher in a year of athletic prosperity the likes of which have never been seen in Oklahoma   And OSU is going to lose their bowl game
Nice play Thornton
I would want a hug from the Red Mamba I MEAN TIM DUNCAN IS WORST DM EVER NO ONE WANTS TO PLAY DnD WITH HIM EVEN HIS OWN TEAM
Lol ughh
he lost acy he wasnt happy at all
FFS Hope its nothing serious I want to see him become a great center hes definitely on track to becoming one
FUCK THE HEAT Pacers are cool though
eh he usually comes out around that mark
Would yall stop spelling Funyuns wrong already
Holy shit that KFC commercial was cringe worthy
On behalf of every NBA fan thank you
Not much Were talking about a guy who cant spotup dribble defend rebound set picks or pass He will rarely get fouled You can throw him in there for late game FT situations but thats it 
well appreciated
FUNNY HOW A TORNADO CAN LIVEN THINGS UP FUCK THATS AN OXYMORON MY BAD INB4 2013 WAS THE BOMB
Some thanks should also go to Ryan Succop as well for missing that FG 
Dwight is abusing the Kings
I feed my kids KFC cuz Im a great mom
Offensive indeed
I like the improvement were seeing from the Kings bench since the last practice
Jimmer is impressing me tonight But he played like this in the first half against the heat then proceeded to be the worst Ive ever seen him in the second half
Sac annoucers Jeremy lin is skilled but hes not quick what
Sorry bro its cause we dont got those in Canada
Lol my old coach used to give the old its a street fight speech Great video
Plumlee really can get up
My body is ready
Classic Jimmer You get a 4 on 2 and the ball gets knocked away
One of his big 3 is ginobli 2nd rounder and foreign Wow big potential Parker was not an elite pg when he came in Is that anything like Kobe or shaq 
Their reference point for quick is Isaiah Thomas
Dat deceptive quickness
They have been deceived
Not the prettiest post player but he always manages to scoop it in somehow 
no
THE WNBA TEAM THAT PLAYS IN THE SAME BUILDING AS YOU HAS MORE CHAMPIONSHIPS AND TITLES THAN YOU YOU SHOULD BE DEMOTED TO THE WNBA
I thought it was Oakland
youre thinking fourperson family figures
Did the Rockets broadcast team just refer to the Kings as Rudys team  Cmon son
i want someone to pick up that little point guard thats on the sixers dleague team  taquille carr  i think thats his name  im sure hes garbage but his scouting videos were nextlevel
How did Jeremy get that rebound
I would argue Dwight Howard deserved it that year
How does Lin get that board over Gray
Take the lead dammit
I would argue Dwight Howard deserved it that year But your point stands
Every one knows that was Notre Dame CMon
Surprises me its still useful in the NBA Youd think players would see this a mile away when its ran everytime in the NCAA
HUSTALIN
Whos your Pick to Click Ill take Batum 
Determination
Someone needs to seriously investigate these calls There I said it
Favorite Moment My boy Robbie Hummel making the Timberwolves roster after 2 torn ACLs Prediction Heat lose in the ECF to the Pacers Bosh opts out of his contract and signs with his hometown Houston Rockets
According to the bulls twitter Deng is playing tonight  Edit Also great post 
Deception
Wishing a Happy New Year to all Be careful dodging all the potatoes on the road tonight THUNDER UP
So
Double Fuck Blake Griffin
I find myself alone on New Years Eve Any Torontonians find themselves in the same predicament and want to celebrate the New Year together TTCVIVA is free so I have no qualms about going pretty much anywhere that isnt way too far
Theres enough sadness in this thread without Laker fans making bad jokes
Precisely The skill of the refs has probably improved if anything its just that we as fans can see the mistakes made so clearly now
Thats one step removed from being a Mavericks fan You dont  like the Mavs  do you
looks like dwill hurt his cankles again
im in college so yes
I like it when we do those offensive rebound things
How many times this year has Deron come up limping Its nearly every game at this point
They got Dion Waiters though
WELL TAKE HIM
Been a brutal stretch of games for the Blazers recently LAC MIA NOP OKC Hopefully this doesnt prove to be yet another heart breaker 
And to think I was going to waste time watching this game thanks future person
There are definitely worse ways to celebrate New Years Happy new year to you good sir
Youre saying Rose was a legit MVP He wasnt
Man all of you Americans are really missing out in this whole 2014 thing Its CRAAAAZY in this new year I cant even begin to explain how bonkers everything has become 
13 will be back before Derrick Rose
NOOOOOOOOOO ATDHE IS DOWN any alt links Edit nvm atdheeu is up
Good luck blazinbro
Kendrick have a dream
What the hell is an offensive rebound Are you even allowed to catch your own misses
I thought he had no ankles or shoulders though
I was trying to say Tony Parker was lucky enough to get drafted to the spurs  He had a chance to develop and the first few years of his career he got to play with little pressure behind Tim Manu and even a year with David Robinson Other than the 07 championship he was not the main reason they won any other year  Chris Paul was guy who was brought into a losing franchise to be a franchise changer which he sort of did  Imagine if Chris had pieces like Tim and Manu and was able to play for Coach Pop  The rings thing is overrated because Chris Paul never got the chance to be around the talent Tony has and Tony wasnt the reason his team kept winning Its almost like saying Pippen is stillgtgt Bron because of 6 rings to 2
Hey Dont speak for me I can do it myself Jnzi thanks bro
PRETTY NICE HAD 26 PTS LAST NIGHT WATCH HIM PLAY AND YOUD KNOW
Pls Lillard no last second threes pls
didnt realize kobes been in the league longer than duncan until now
Kind of surprised that they didnt call the foul on Splitter there
You can either have sympathy from smallmarket team fans or dynasty after dynasty  Choose one  If I was better with photoshop Id edit ShaqKobeMagicKareemWiltBaylors faces onto the 100 bills that Woody Harrelson wipes his tears with in that one gif  Embrace the hate like the Yankees do
you know hardens gonna have to play some defense
This is for consecutive years
Dwight is definitely the focus right now  good to see
Any Toronto streams
Marcus Thorton is looking like a superstar out there
Even on new years eve he comes through What a bloody legend  Happy new year
And the Bulls played very well without Jordan Take it away from Jordan 
Justin Hamilton and Varnado were both drafted by the heat as projects Varnado i think is the alltime shot blocking leader in the NCAA 
Red alt jerseys tonight Go Blazers Happy new year everyone
Pops brings out the talent of every player Its actually pretty amazing how some of the guys who dont seem that gifted are able to play so well for him 
I am forever a Aaron Brooks fan for that
I think Houston had it I dont know if we still do Im pretty sure OKC does
The one Warriors game Im able to go to Steph Curry gets rest  it was fun seeing David Lee go off though GSW is my western conference team
Yep Cant argue with that 
I didnt know there was so much love for Magics speaking ability around here  Im shocked but I wont delete it like everyone else does Bask in its beauty  
Even the Knicks arent planning for anyone to join them in 6 years
At this rate I will finish my degree before Harden starts playing defense  Marcus Thornton already had 15 points in the first half off the bench
Kyle lowry scares me I hope joakim and taj make it hard for him at the rim
How is that happening  Whos guarding himoh
8 assists for Thomas The starting role has worked for him Hes never been this consistent in his career as he has this season
Hey dont spoil it for me
Happy New Year ya Swedish bastard
Down 20 and Jason Kidd is straight chilling on the bench
Take him
He left after the 2009 Finals though
Nope Oakland 
Its what I do
This is the first game Ive turned off before the half since we moved to Brooklyn Im pooped 
Dame is gonna drop bombs tonight I can feel it And LA is going to go 48291312 with a KD Perkins and Scott Brooks posterizing dunk from the 3 point line you heard it here first
You guys want him Give us cashconsiderations 
fixing the end of game situations where not even a broken arm would get a whistle Obviously that isnt the case seeings as though the NBA said this play should have been a foul
Instead of playing defense Harden decided to stand there and scratch his nose until someone gave him the inbound
Start an oldwhiteguy blues band
Wexler just needs to fuck her already 
A god among us indeed
Really appreciate it Thanks
I volunteer as tribute
And those big hairy Canadians with the teeth and the claws and the fondness for honey are pretty nasty too Tried to say hello to one of them once and the motherfucker mauled me and stole my salmon Thought they were supposed to be polite up there
Harden literally standing there scratching his head
Ive always loved how the NBA phrased that Like can I give my dealer cash considerations next time I pick up
It changed the number of free throws Love would have taken thats all I can argue definitively  Anybody arguing that it would have changed the games outcome is just a liar as theres no way to prove that 
Thanks dude
Haha youre funny I was being sarcastic with the half remark No need to get pissy now 
Lakers management is a mess without Dr Buss Period Trade Gasol for essentially nothing to save 20m this year while having just committed 48m for the next two years to Kobe who may or may not be able to produce DAntoni is still the coach Trade Gasol away for the guy you traded away to get a one year rental of Howard And then youre going to waive that guy after that
The Peake We have the best name for any sporting complex in the world and its under utilized  THUNDERDOME
Oh shit Joey Crawford in the house tonight
Thats awesome
Or it could mean that he doesnt rebound thus allowing others to grab the boards he misses Im not saying this is the case but you can argue it either way
I dunno its more quantity but the quality suffers I mean the heat vs the bucks last year Yea its fun to watch but Id rather they faced a good team that was equally well rested  Better game to watch that way IMO
Same here resident of Phoenix
DAE Western Conference master race
gtSymphony No3 in B fat I mean we all thought it
Thats just hurtful
Yeah I mentioned that about Varnado Varnado was drafted by the heat and Hamilton was acquired in a trade with the Sixers but both were waived by the heat and are now on waivers
Jesus Christ everyone acts like this was the worst thing in NBA history Rose was in the conversation whether you like it or not He was seen as LeBrons only competition for the award until Dwights crazy end of the season  Rose was a legitimate MVP candidate and you have to respect that whether he won it or not
Still it would be nice if the salaries were significantly higher than they are now which would give guys more incentive to play in the dleague and showcase for the NBA That surely makes a teams scouting a lot easier
17 points for Gay already No biggie
Me too I hate it when theres news of a player being sad and everybody immediately dismisses their problems because theyre rich and post that crying with the money gif Its rarely ever the player saying he has it harder than somebody with financial problems too Problems are relative people I understand its not nearly as bad as being poor but show some respect
Im not saying thats the only reason But child support is a bitch to pay I know some people from afar who has to deal with it Theres a reason why I put and In ca child support is handled by the mother if she has custody so what I implied is good for him that he doesnt have to pay her shit I really loved how you attacked my character over the internet but hey you can do anything behind a computer
Im honestly surprised the Nets have 10 wins  They just look so bad every time I watch them  Make Teletovic look like a near Max player at times
you2 ma man  all the way from the uk 
If we come back and win this one Im blaming our thirdquarter collapses on you
True fans who want 15 dollar tickets
Its a testament to LeBrons brilliance that a fatter much worse version of him is still pretty high praise 
Do you guys remember Kevin Garnett Man he was pretty good 8 months ago
100 point game
Dont worry we are keeping him well fed and providing a great home for him 
HAHA KNICKS U TOOK A L for 2014 BECAUSE OF THAT PRIMO PASTA  TRADE
The Kings are playing team ball They are looking gooood
great post and very glad you included games played to really show the difference between MJ and the other two greats  Just a suggestion I think it might work better going in chronological order with MJ Kobe then LeBron 
Eh I still feel like international leagues are the best bet for undrafted players the market for live basketball is already too saturated since pretty much anyone who can see a DLeague game can see an NBA game
Plumlee is not giving up Props to him for being a warrior tonight
Gametime showing the Chicago pregame intros That video is so hype
Happy new year Blazerbros Hopefully this game thread has a little more of the holiday spirit than the last one
I just tried to open the BKN official app to check the stats and my phone gave me the message Brooklyn Nets has stopped Indeed phone
mate  yet again you provide the goods your a fuckin star an unaware Saviour to a UK person lol  plz keep it up all the best for 2014
Im watching this game from the green room of Neumos a venue Im DJing at tonight in Seattle  GO RAPS
amir johnson looked stunned  this is so sad but i hope they all do well in scramento 
Haha touche
Yeah but the nets as a team rebound better overall with him on the court than with him off Im not arguing hes some elite rebounder whose value isnt expressed through stats but he clearly contributes to rebounding in a way that doesnt show up in the box score 
AS voting has two guards and three frontcourt players Hence why the starting lineup is looking like it will be IrvingWadeGeorgeAnthonyJames SFs are forwards Of course there are some exceptional SFs who can handle a huge playmaking role but for the typical SF theres more focus on rebounding than assisting  
Thats a bit of a grand statement Hes a highenergy rookie trying to prove himself not some noble competitor
I never knew the toronto locker room was so close and tight with one another Its actually really nice to see that 
I dont know him personally and wish the best towards his personal life But having custody of your kids and also not paying child support to your exgirlfriend seems like a winwin 
Each ref could have a neural connection to a player to instantly tell if they got hit or not and whether or not their flop was real
I hope he retires after this season
Why not both
Deceptive athleticism
